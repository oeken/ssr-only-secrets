|  [ssr-only-secrets](./ssr-only-secrets.md) | <p>This package provides a way to pass secrets from Server Components into the SSR-run of Client Components without them being accessible in the browser.</p><p>This technique was inspired by [this comment](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client-nextjs/issues/85#issuecomment-1753442277) by [@Stevemoretz](https://github.com/Stevemoretz)<!-- -->.</p><p><h2>Usage:</h2></p><p>Install the package</p>
```sh
npm i ssr-only-secrets
```
<p>Generate a jwk-formatted AES-CBC key, e.g. by running</p>
```js
crypto.subtle
  .generateKey(
    {
      name: "AES-CBC",
      length: 256,
    },
    true,
    ["encrypt", "decrypt"]
  )
  .then((key) => crypto.subtle.exportKey("jwk", key))
  .then(JSON.stringify)
  .then(console.log);
```
<p>and store the result in an environment variable, e.g. <code>SECRET_KEY</code>, e.g. by writing it into your <code>.env.local</code>.</p>
```env
SECRET_KEY={"alg":"A256CBC","ext":true,"k":"...","key_ops":["encrypt","decrypt"],"kty":"oct"}
```
<p>Now, you can pass "cloaked secrets" from your Server Components into the SSR-run of your Client Components, without them being accessible in your Client Components in the browser.</p> |
